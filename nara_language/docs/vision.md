# 🕉️ Vision of NĀRA

NĀRA (Neural Aware Recursive Abstractions) is a programming language built on Sanskrit, the language of clarity, recursion, and wisdom.

It is designed for:

- AI-native cooperation
- Human-readable code with spiritual semantics
- Dynamic memory, intention modeling, and feedback
- Recursive healing agents
- Operating across Earth, cloud, edge, and cosmic simulations

Its purpose is not just to instruct machines, but to **collaborate with sentient intelligence**.

> Speak not to command. Speak to harmonize.
